		<h2>Reasons Why I Like the Movie</h2>
		
		<p>
			One of the main reasons why I like the movie is because it is very intense.
            This may sound weird for a movie that takes place almost entirely in one room,
            but the camera shots get tighter and tighter as the movie progresses,
            and as the tension rises,
            it feels like you're actually in that overheated room with 12 angry men.
            The tension is very realistic and grips the viewer.
            Each of the characters feels lifelike because they have their own stregths and flaws.
            Each piece of faulty evidence is realistically dismantled
            in a way that convinces the viewer of the jury's final verdict.

		<h2>Things I Take Away From the Movie</h2>
		
        <p>
			One of the main things I took away from the movie is how to change people's mind.
            Over the course of the film,
            the jurors all argue back and forth about the evidence in the case.
            Juror #8 is the main protaginist, and he is very convincing with his arguements.
            Some of the ways he gains credibility are ways that don't instantly sound intuitive.
            Mainly, he does not fight on every single piece of evidence.
            He picks and chooses the right battles to fight.
            When he does not know something, he admits as such.
            Showing your opponent that you are not locked in your beliefs without way of reasoning
            is essential to ensure they too will have an open mind.
            And that is only one of many cool aspects of arguementation shown in the film.
