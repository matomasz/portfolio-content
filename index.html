		<h1>12 Angry Men</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Welcome to my portfolio websie on the movie 12 angry men.
			I first saw the movie in an 8th grade class called "Liberty and Justice for All".
			The class revolved around the American Justice System and how it worked.
			Although this movie was tangentially related to that subject matter,
			I'm not sure that watching it was the best use of class time.
			Nevertheless, I am very glad we did, because it is now my favorite movie of all time.
		</p>
		<br/>

			Now, for a little more about the movie, I will give an introduction.
			The movie came out in 1957 and stars Henry Fonda in its lead role.
			He plays Juror #8, one of 12 jurors that remain unnamed through the course of the film.
			This jury of 12 members is given the responsibility of deciding a murder case
			in which a young boy stands accused of murdering his father.
			Unfortunately for that young boy, the prosecution has made a really good case against him.
			The movie starts right as the jury are leaving the courtroom to deliberate.
			In the deliberation room, they first take a poll to see where everyone stands on the verdict.
			11 hands raise for guilty, 1 hand raises for not. I will stop there for now, but will get into
			more of the story and my analysis on this website's other pages.
		</p>

			If you have not yet seen the movie and it sounds interesting to,
			I urge you to watch it blind before continuing into this site (as there are many spoilers ahead).

			A movie poster with a yellow background.
			Across the top is a banner with all 12 jurors drawn in black and white.
			A knife down the middle of the poster divides the quote 
			'Life is in there hands-' and 'Death is on their minds!'.
			Beneath that is the quote 'It explodes like 12 sticks of dynamite!'
			The tip of the knife sticks into the 2 in the title 'Henry Fonda 12 Angry Men'.
			The bottom shows a picture of Henry Fonda 
			and a top down view of the rest of the jurors at the deliberation table.
